An alias to `Endpoint` is provided for compatibility.\r\n- Renamed `WebsocketObserver` to `WebsocketServerObserver`.\r\n\r\n### Upgrading from v1.x to v2.0\r\n\r\nThis library has been refactored to use the new [`amphp\/websocket`](https:\/\/github.com\/amphp\/websocket) library containing components that can be shared between server and clients.\r\n\r\n`Websocket` is now a final class that requires an instance of `ClientHandler`, which has two methods to handle client handshakes and the client connection.\r\n- `handleHandshake()`: This method is invoked when a WebSocket connection attempt is made. The application may alter the given Response to deny the connection attempt or set application-specific headers.\r\n- `handleClient()`: This method is invoked upon a successful WebSocket connection. This method should use a loop to receive messages from the WebSocket connection.\r\n\r\n```php\r\nuse Amp\\Http\\Server\\Request;\r\nuse Amp\\Http\\Server\\Response;\r\nuse Amp\\Http\\Status;\r\nuse Amp\\Success;\r\nuse Amp\\Websocket\\Client;\r\nuse Amp\\Websocket\\Server\\ClientHandler;\r\nuse Amp\\Websocket\\Server\\Gateway;\r\nuse Amp\\Websocket\\Server\\Websocket;\r\n\r\n$websocket = new Websocket(new class implements ClientHandler {\r\n    public function handleHandshake(Gateway $gateway, Request $request, Response $response): Promise\r\n    {\r\n        if (!\\in_array($request->getHeader('origin'), ['http:\/\/localhost:1337', 'http:\/\/127.0.0.1:1337', 'http:\/\/[::1]:1337'], true)) {\r\n            return $gateway->getErrorHandler()->handleError(Status::FORBIDDEN, 'Origin forbidden', $request);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return new Success($response);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public function handleClient(Gateway $gateway, Client $client, Request $request, Response $response): Promise\r\n    {\r\n        return Amp\\call(function () use ($gateway, $client) {\r\n            while ($message = yield $client->receive()) {\r\n                \\assert($message instanceof Message);\r\n                $gateway->broadcast(\\sprintf('%d: %s', $client->getId(), yield $message->buffer()));\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nWebSocket clients are now represented by a [`Client`](https:\/\/github.com\/amphp\/websocket\/blob\/v1.0.0\/src\/Client.php) object. This object contains several methods for getting information about the client and for sending messages to a single client.\r\n\r\nServers can send to multiple clients using `Gateway::broadcast()` and `Gateway::multicast()` (plus binary versions, `Gateway::broadcastBinary()` and `Gateway::multicastBinary()`). A `Gateway` instance is provided to `ClientHandler::handleHandshake()` and `ClientHandler::handleClient()`.\r\n","revolt":false},{"name":"amphp\/serialization 1.0.0","package":"amphp\/serialization","tag_name":"v1.0.0","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/amphp\/serialization\/releases\/tag\/v1.0.0","date":"2020-03-28T14:03:14Z","body":"Initial release.","revolt":true},{"name":"amphp\/http-tunnel 1.0.0","package":"amphp\/http-tunnel","tag_name":"v1.0.0","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/amphp\/http-tunnel\/releases\/tag\/v1.0.0","date":"2019-12-31T17:10:50Z","body":"Initial release.","revolt":false},{"name":"amphp\/http-client-cache 1.0.0","package":"amphp\/http-client-cache","tag_name":"v1.0.0","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/amphp\/http-client-cache\/releases\/tag\/v1.0.0","date":"2019-12-21T19:52:55Z","body":"Initial release.","revolt":false},{"name":"amphp\/react-adapter 2.1.0","package":"amphp\/react-adapter","tag_name":"v2.1.0","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/amphp\/react-adapter\/releases\/tag\/v2.1.0","date":"2019-11-04T22:20:56Z","body":" - `React\\EventLoop\\Factory` is now automatically replaced with another implementation that throws on each usage to prevent two loops existing concurrently by accident.\r\n   Set `AMP_REACT_ADAPTER_DISABLE_FACTORY_OVERRIDE=1` as environment variable or constant to disable this protection.","revolt":false},{"name":"amphp\/http-server-router 1.0.2","package":"amphp\/http-server-router","tag_name":"v1.0.2","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/amphp\/http-server-router\/releases\/tag\/v1.0.2","date":"2019-08-21T15:53:16Z","body":"Allow `amphp\/http-server@^2`","revolt":false},{"name":"amphp\/react-stream-adapter 0.1.0","package":"amphp\/react-stream-adapter","tag_name":"v0.1.0","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/amphp\/react-stream-adapter\/releases\/tag\/v0.1.0","date":"2018-03-07T10:13:55Z","body":"Initial release.","revolt":false}]
