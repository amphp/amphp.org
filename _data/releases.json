A component to request server sockets from a parent process is now included as part of the public API, as well as a pair of components to transfer client sockets between processes.\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n- Added `ServerSocketPipeFactory` and `ServerSocketPipeProvider` for requesting and providing server sockets to a child process from a parent process ([Documentation](https:\/\/github.com\/amphp\/cluster\/tree\/2.x#transferring-server-sockets)).\r\n- Added `ClientSocketReceivePipe` and `ClientSocketSendPipe` for transferring client sockets and related data between processes ([Documentation](https:\/\/github.com\/amphp\/cluster\/tree\/2.x#transferring-client-sockets)).\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- `Cluster::getId()` has been renamed to `Cluster::getContextId()`, returning the worker ID or null if not running as a cluster worker.\r\n- `Cluster::listen()` has been replaced with `Cluster::getServerSocketFactory()`, which returns an instance of `Amp\\Socket\\SocketServerFactory` that may be used to create a server or passed to components requiring an instance of that interface.\r\n- `Cluster::onMessage()` and `Cluster::send()` has been replaced with `Cluster::getChannel()`, returning an instance of `Amp\\Sync\\Channel` which may be used to send and receive messages from the cluster watcher.\r\n- `Cluster::onTerminate()` has been replaced with `Cluster::awaitTermination()` which awaits a signal from the cluster watch to stop.\r\n- `Watcher` has been renamed to `ClusterWatcher`.\r\n- `Watcher::onMessage()` has been replaced with `ClusterWatcher::getMessageIterator()`, returning a concurrent iterator of `ClusterWorkerMessage` objects.",
